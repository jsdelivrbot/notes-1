# Thursday, Oct 29th

## Challenge:
```js
// Trolls are attacking your comment section!
//
// A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
//
// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
//
// For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

function disemvowel(str) {
  return str;
}

console.assert(disemvowel("This website is for losers LOL!") === "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!")
```
