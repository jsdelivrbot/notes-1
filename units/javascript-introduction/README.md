## What is "programming?"

I like this description from Kyle Simpson's [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/ch1.md)

> A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform. Usually code is saved in a text file...

> The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a computer language, sometimes referred to as its syntax, much the same as English tells you how to spell words and how to create valid sentences using words and punctuation.

JavaScript is a programming language, as are Ruby, PHP, Python, C, Java, etc. Each language has different syntax, but they are all simply a set of instructions for the computer to follow.

## Introduction to JavaScript Programming

Kyle Simpson does an excellent job of explaining the core principles of programming from a JavaScript perspective, so rather than duplicating his work I'll just link to it:

## JavaScript is a calculator

I like to think about JavaScript as a really fancy calculator that your browser uses to manipulate information. At the end of the day, everything we do with JavaScript is manipulation of information, so it makes sense to start out with the different types of information we might want to manipulate.

JavaScript has a notion of **types**, which are different categories of information that we can manipulate. In our introduction we are going to talk about *three* of the most important types in JavaScript. Those types are: numbers, strings and booleans.

## Numbers

JavaScript numbers are pretty much the same as numbers that we'd use to calculate things with a calculator. We can perform **operations** on them, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

Our JavaScript code is made up of a series of **expressions** like the one below:

```js
2+2
```

In the expression above, we are adding two different numbers together. Expressions in JavaScript can often be simplified, or **evaluated**. For example, `2+2` is evaluated to another number, `4`. Simple enough eh?

If you remember back to your arithmetic days, there is a special order in which mathematical operations are performed. Do you Remember *PEMDAS* or *please excuse my dear aunt sally*? These are easy ways to remember the order in which mathematical operations are done. The order is:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication / Division
4. Addition / Subtraction

This is all the math you will ever need to know to become a web developer. Let's look at the following JavaScript expression:

```js
2+2*3
```

JavaScript is not smart. It can't evaluate this expression all at once. It has to break it down into parts, and do one operation at a time. Based on the order of operations we laid out above here are the steps JavaScript will take.

1. `2*3` is equal to `6`. The multiplication is done first because it has a higher precedence than addition.
2. After the multiplication calculation is complete, the expression will look like: `2+6`. This is simple enough. Now JavaScript will do the addition and get a final value of `8`.
